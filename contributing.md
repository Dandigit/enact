# Contributing to Enact

Welcome to the Enact project. It's wonderful to have you here to contribute!
Before you get started helping out, have a quick read over this guide to know what to expect.

## Code of Conduct

All participation in the Enact project is to be governed by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Dandigit/matilda/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any abusive behaviour may be reported to
`enact@dandigit.com`.

## How can I contribute?

### Bug reports

If you find a bug in Enact, open a **Bug Report** issue and fill out the template! Help us improve the experience by providing
detailed reports with plenty of info.

### Feature requests

Perhaps you use Enact on the daily and think there's a missing piece of the language that's really bugging you. Propose a new
feature by opening a **Feature Request** issue. Keep in mind that all feature requests are purely proposals and may or may not
become part of the language.

### Writing code

If you're fluent in C++ you can be a huge help to the Enact project. Take a look at bug reports and see if there's any you'd
like to fix, then submit a pull request fixing the bug and explaining how you fixed it. Make sure to include the original bug 
report in your PR. Approved feature requests waiting for implementation can also use your help. Submit a pull request with your 
implementation of the feature, including the original feature request issue.

Hopefully you've been inspired to contribute to Enact in one way or another! I look forward to seeing you around!
