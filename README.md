Enact is a new programming language that's not designed to be unique or groundbreaking. Instead, Enact takes already 
established technologies and paradigms and just makes them <strong>nicer</strong>.
</p>

## Example
```
// FizzBuzz in Enact

fun main():
    each i in 1..20:
        given i % 3 == 0, i % 5 == 0:
            when true, true:
                print("FizzBuzz")
            when true, false:
                print("Fizz")
            when false, true:
                print("Buzz")
            else:
                print(i)
        end
    end
end
```

## Goals
- Enact aims to make dealing with data easier through a variety of high-level but high-performance constructs.
- It should be powerful, but shouldn't have a giant learning curve.
- Code should be logical and pretty, not hacky and weird.
